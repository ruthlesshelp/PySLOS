Test plan for the Python-based Student Loan Origination System (SLOS).

---

## ✅ Test Plan Document  
**System Name**: PySLOS – Python Student Loan Origination System  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Author**: Stephen Ritchie

---

### 1. Executive Summary  
This test plan outlines the strategy for validating the functionality, reliability, and performance of PySLOS. It includes unit, integration, and system testing using modern Python tools and practices.

---

### 2. Testing Objectives  
- Validate business logic and financial calculations  
- Ensure data integrity and persistence  
- Verify input validation and error handling  
- Confirm system reliability and performance  
- Prevent regressions and maintain high code quality

---

### 3. Scope of Testing  
- **In Scope**: Core business logic, financial calculations, data access, validation rules  
- **Out of Scope**: UI testing (CLI or web), penetration testing, performance load testing

---

### 4. Test Strategy

#### 4.1 Testing Layers  
- **Unit Tests**: Isolated logic using `pytest` and `unittest.mock`  
- **Integration Tests**: Real database operations using `pytest` and `SQLAlchemy`  
- **System Tests**: End-to-end workflows via CLI or REST API using `pytest` and `requests`

#### 4.2 Test Design Principles  
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)  
- Data-driven and boundary value testing  
- Equivalence partitioning and error path validation

---

### 5. Test Environment

#### 5.1 Infrastructure  
- **Frameworks**: `pytest`, `unittest`, `FactoryBoy`, `Faker`  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (test schema)  
- **Mocking**: `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins

#### 5.2 Configuration  
- `.env.test` for test-specific settings  
- Docker containers for isolated test environments  
- Auto-generated schema via SQLAlchemy models

---

### 6. Test Cases by Component

#### 6.1 Financial Calculations  
- Validate monthly payment computation  
- APR to monthly rate conversion  
- Boundary checks for principal, term, and rate

#### 6.2 Business Logic  
- Student age validation (16–26 years)  
- DOB constraints (past, not future)  
- Entity creation and update workflows

#### 6.3 Data Access  
- CRUD operations for `Individual`, `Student`, `Application`  
- Foreign key integrity and cascade delete prevention  
- Retrieval and update of related records

---

### 7. Test Data Management  
- **Sources**: JSON or YAML fixtures  
- **Generation**: `Faker` for randomized valid data  
- **Validation**: Schema checks using `pydantic` or `marshmallow`

---

### 8. Test Execution Strategy  
- **Development Phase**: Continuous unit testing  
- **Pre-Commit**: Full unit suite must pass  
- **Integration Phase**: Weekly database tests  
- **System Phase**: Pre-release end-to-end validation

---

### 9. Automation & Reporting  
- CI pipeline: commit → build → test → report  
- Coverage tools: `coverage.py`, `pytest-cov`  
- Reporting: HTML reports, Slack/GitHub notifications  
- Metrics: pass rate, execution time, coverage %, defect density

---

### 10. Coverage Goals  
- Financial Calculations: 100%  
- Business Rules: ≥ 95%  
- Data Operations: ≥ 85%  
- Input Validation: ≥ 90%

---

### 11. Risk Assessment  
- **Technical Risks**: DB corruption, test isolation, performance  
- **Process Risks**: Coverage gaps, outdated tests, skill gaps  
- **Mitigation**: Isolated environments, mandatory reviews, training

---

### 12. Success Criteria  
- ≥ 95% test pass rate  
- ≥ 90% coverage for critical components  
- No open P1/P2 defects  
- Regression suite passes  
- All release gates met
